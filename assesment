The slide task: Demonstrate OCP in action (code demo)

Goal: show how to extend functionality safely without modifying existing logic (Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification).

I’ll use the shape area scenario — compute area for many shapes. First show a bad version (violates OCP) then refactor to an OCP-compliant design. Finally, add a new shape showing we didn’t change the existing code.


What the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) means

OCP = Open for extension, closed for modification.

It means you should be able to add new features (extend behavior) without changing existing code that already works.
We achieve this using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
